## Creating a Repository for a New Course

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new repository based on the template repository. 
The naming format for the new repository will follow the convention: `<coursename>-<F for fall, S for Spring><year>`.

### Steps

1. **Access the Template Repository**
   - Navigate to the [template](https://github.com/utce-docs/template) repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the "Use this template" button located near the top-right corner of the repository page.

2. **Create a New Repository**
   - You will be redirected to the "Create a new repository" page.
   - Enter a **descriptive name** for your new repository, following the `<coursename>-<F/S><year>` format.
   - Optionally, provide a brief **description** for the repository to provide more context.
   - Choose the **visibility** (public, private, or internal) according to your requirements.
   - If desired, initialize the repository with a **README** file, a **license**, or a **.gitignore** file based on your project needs.

3. **Configure Repository Options**
   - Review and modify the repository options as needed.
   - You can adjust options such as branch protection rules, repository settings, or other project-specific configurations.

4. **Create the Repository**
   - Click on the "Create repository" button to finalize the creation of your new repository.

5. **Customize and Modify**
   - Once the repository is created, you will be redirected to its main page.
   - Customize the repository by modifying the files, updating the README, and making any necessary changes specific to your project requirements.

6. **Collaboration and Usage**
   - Share the repository URL with collaborators or team members who will be working on the project.
   - Communicate any guidelines or instructions for the repository's usage, such as branching models, issue tracking, or pull request workflows.

7. **Version Control and Development**
   - Clone the newly created repository to your local development environment using Git.
   - Begin working on your project, making commits, and pushing changes to the repository.

8. **Ongoing Maintenance**
   - Regularly update and maintain the repository to reflect the latest project developments.
   - Encourage collaboration, pull requests, and issue reporting to foster a healthy and active project community.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new repository for your course.
